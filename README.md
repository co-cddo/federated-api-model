# Federated API Discovery Model

This repository contains all work related to the [Data Standards Authority's](https://alphagov.github.io/data-standards-authority/) work towards producing a federated API discovery model for UK government.

This model is designed for teams within and across different public sector agencies to discover APIs, separate from their API documentation or specifications, to understand what APIs are available and to make it easier for users to find them.

The federated aspect of this model allows a push- and pull-based approach, allowing the use of different catalogues across government, as well as the [public government API catalogue](https://www.api.gov.uk).

The aim of this model is that it promotes standardisation of data shared about APIs. To reduce privacy and security concerns, it shares a minimal data set, with the hope of increasing the number of APIs which organisations feel comfortable publishing details about.

## Project Backlog

As well as GitHub issues on the repository, we also have a [Project](https://github.com/orgs/co-cddo/projects/1) set up for this repository.
